      Hello! my name is Tyler Wilson. Right now, I am a 20 year old university student studying computer science
      and economics at New York University Shanghai!
    </p>
    <!--<p>
      Over the summer I did two internships, one with blockchain for supply chain company, Endchain, and the other
      with IoT predictive sensor start up, Prediktas. My time here was great. I learned what it was like to work in a
      tech environment, and learned a lot of new skills. I originially stared university as an economics major, but
      in my Sophomore year switched to computer science. These internships really reinforced this decision, and I am really
      excited to grow my skills and learn more as I go through university. Right now, I am looking for software engineering
      and interships for the summer of 2020.
    </p>-->
    <p>
      Aside from my passion for technology, I love to workout and spend time outside, listen to music (I am learning to dj too!),
      play video games with my friends, and travel to new places. If you want to keep up with me and hear more about
      my very opionated opinons about music, sports, tech, travel, and more, check out my blog!
      What is going on?
